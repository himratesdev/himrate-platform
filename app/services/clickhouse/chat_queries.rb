  # TASK-251.14d: ClickHouse-side equivalents of the 4 chat queries TrustIndex::ContextBuilder
  # currently runs against Postgres. Each method returns the SAME shape as its PG counterpart so the
  # downstream signal pipeline doesn't care which store served the read. Used by ContextBuilder when
  # the :chat_reads_clickhouse_dual_read flag (parity validation) OR :chat_reads_clickhouse flag
  # (CH-only flip) is ON.
  #
  # Window alignment (CR-198 Nit-2): the MVs aggregate at minute granularity (toStartOfMinute), so
  # PG and CH only stay in 0-divergence parity if both READ at minute-rounded boundaries.
  # ContextBuilder floors `since` to the minute before dispatch — the same floor is applied to the
  # PG path so dual-read compares apples-to-apples.
  #
  # `cross_channel` reads RAW chat_messages (per SRS revision after the DSV — raw columnar scan = 30
  # ms, exact rolling-24h semantics) rather than an MV; the rolling window is what enables true
  # 0-divergence vs Postgres at the 1d flip. The username list is ORDER BY username so PG and CH
  # pick the same deterministic 500 (PG path was tweaked to match for parity).
